# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Project #1: Navigation
In this project, we train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a 3D square space.

The simulation environment is based on Unity Environment. The code is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/python/unityagents)

### Rewards
- +1 for getting a yellow banana
- -1 for getting a blue banana

### States
There are 37 states in this environment.

Those include the agent's velocity and ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.

However, there is no clear description of each state element from Udacity as discussed [here](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/22697)

### Actions
The agent can take 4 actions.

0. Move forward
1. Move backward.
2. Turn left
3. Turn right.

### Criteria
If the average score of the latest 100 episodes is more than 13, it is consider as solved.
